Mobile users will get the watermarks by February 12th. They’ll include both an invisible metadata component and a visible CR symbol, which will appear in the top left corner of each image.</p><p>People can check the provenance — which AI tool was used to make the content — of any image generated by OpenAI’s platforms through websites like Content Credentials Verify. So far, only still images, not videos or text, can carry the watermark. </p><p>OpenAI says adding the watermark metadata to images represents a “negligible effect on latency and will not affect the quality of the image generation.” It will also increase image sizes slightly for some tasks. </p><p>The C2PA, a group consisting of companies like Adobe and Microsoft, has been pushing the use of the Content Credentials watermark to identify the provenance of content and show if it was made by humans or with AI. Adobe created a Content Credentials symbol, which OpenAI is adding to DALL-E 3 creations. Meta recently announced it will add tags to AI-generated content on its social media platforms. </p><p>Identifying AI-generated content is one of the flagship directives in the Biden administration’s executive order on AI. But watermarking is not a surefire way to stop misinformation. OpenAI points out that C2PA’s metadata can “easily be removed either accidentally or intentionally,” especially as most social media platforms often remove metadata from uploaded content. Taking a screenshot omits the metadata.</p><p>“We believe that adopting these methods for establishing provenance and encouraging users to recognize these signals are key to increasing the trustworthiness of digital information,” OpenAI says on its site.</p>', 'images/1.jpg', 2, 1, 10, '2023-03-08 11:08:26', '2024-03-08 11:08:26'),

Under Labour’s proposals, AI firms would have to tell the government, on a statutory basis, whether they were planning to develop AI systems over a certain level of capability and would need to conduct safety tests with “independent oversight”.</p><p>The AI summit testing agreement was backed by the EU and 10 countries including the US, UK, Japan, France and Germany. The tech companies that have agreed to testing of their models include Google, OpenAI, Amazon, Microsoft and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta.</p><p>Kyle, who is in the US visiting Washington lawmakers and tech executives, said the results of the tests would help the newly established UK AI Safety Institute “reassure the public that independently, we are scrutinising what is happening in some of the real cutting-edge parts of … artificial intelligence”.</p><p>He added: “Some of this technology is going to have a profound impact on our workplace, on our society, on our culture.

(4, 'Health Systems Are Improving Patient Outcomes With AI-Assisted Technology', '<p>A better approach would be to focus on the opportunities of AI—healthcare being a great example. AI could play a tremendous role in reducing clinician burden and improving patient experience.</p><p>In the book The AI Revolution in Medicine, Peter Lee of Microsoft suggests that his company’s GPT-4 AI technology could become a “universal translator” for health information, helping both clinicians and patients. Lee speculates that AI could “help consumers decipher and manage their own health data, such as medical bills, lab test results, fitness trackers and health apps by explaining, comparing, personalizing and optimizing the data and providing feedback, recommendations and emotional support.”</p><p>The good news is that we don’t have to speculate too much on how AI can improve healthcare. Hospitals are already deploying AI to improve patient outcomes. Take sepsis, for example. At Kansas City’s Saint Luke’s Health System, where clinicians implemented Epic’s Early Detection of Sepsis system, order-to-antibiotic turnaround time was reduced by 32%, and the mortality index fell by 16%.</p><p>This is good news because sepsis is tricky to diagnose. The CDC estimates that every year 1.7 million adults in America develop sepsis, and nearly 350,000 Americans die or get discharged to hospice with it. Sepsis comprises nearly one-third of deaths in the hospital. Catching it early and administering the right antibiotic treatment is key to reducing morbidity.</p><p>Saint Luke’s also found that using AI to help catch sepsis sooner led to a 48% increase in CMS bundle compliance. Better compliance means that the hospital is not only following established best practices for patient care but also getting better reimbursement. This is particularly promising at a time when many hospitals are shuttering their doors.</p><p>While these models can analyze more than 60 different data points at one time—far more than a physician or other clinicians could do on their own—initial learnings show that the human element is still extremely important. It is less the technology and more the empowerment of the humans who use it. For example, at UCHealth an innovative virtual monitoring team was paired with Epic’s sepsis AI model to create great patient results. UCHealth estimates it saves 375 lives a year.</p>', 'images/4.jpg', 16, 1, 9, '2023-12-06 11:15:03', '2024-02-05 11:15:03'),

For the next two weeks, players who are carrying around 70,000 gold, can toss it straight into the void for 10 achievement points and the sting of being played.</p><p>To get the new achievement, which is called Support Your Local Artisans, players need to speak to an NPC associated with the Artisan\'s Consortium and donate a total of 70,000 gold to them. That\'s it. Any less than that and you won\'t get it.</p><p>Players who have already dropped 10,000 gold toward the achievement say they received 10 bonus Love Tokens, the event\'s unique currency for buying mounts and other cosmetics. Presumably, you can get 60 more tokens if you pay the rest, but that\'s a pretty tiny reward for such a big chunk of cash. I\'ve played WoW long enough to recognize a gold sink when I see one.For the most hardcore players—or the stingiest—70,000 gold isn\'t all that much. With enough time in WoW, you can farm up anything. But in the 20 years since the MMO was released, money-hungry players have gotten too rich. It\'s common for Blizzard to introduce a new mount or item that costs thousands of gold simply to stop them from sitting on all that wealth. It\'s just that usually the thing you get in return is pretty cool. </p><p>I don\'t think 10 achievement points and some extra currency is very cool, and neither do some WoW players who are dumbfounded at the lack of a unique reward.</p><p>\"Achievement hunter and gold-making enthusiast here. I can 100% promise you I am NOT wasting 70K of my hard-earned gold on 10 achievement points,\" Wowhead user Saluun commented.</p><p>\"I JUST DROPPED FIDDY THOUSAND ON THE GOT DANG LUNAR ARMOR,\" X user Kelwinnx wrote, referring to the 50,000 gold mount armor Blizzard added to the game less than 24 hours ago.</p><p>\"If anyone wants to donate that gold to me instead I’ll take it,\" offered Cajunsamurai on Reddit.</p><p>The Love is in the Air event only lasts until February 19, so if you don\'t have the time to grind up that much gold, you\'re out of luck until next year. But there could be other gold sinks with much better rewards that will show up before then. </p><p>This is the price you pay for hunting achievements in an MMO, I guess. You either save all that gold to feel good about a big number or spend it on making a bar go up. But you can\'t exactly ride your 10 achievement points into a city to show off. You will have to live every day alone in the knowledge that you possess one ridiculously expensive achievement for that one time you gave 70,000 gold to an NPC.</p>', 'images/5.jpg', 25, 2, 5, '2024-01-01 11:16:03', '2024-03-04 11:16:03'),

But he landed on his feet at the head of a new Warhammer 40,000 \"cinematic universe,\" and in a new interview with Josh Horowitz he said there\'s nowhere he\'d rather be.</p><p>\"It is the greatest privilege of my professional career to have this opportunity,\" Cavill said of the big-budget Warhammer 40,000 project, which he will both produce and star in. \"I can\'t say too much, again it\'s early days still, but to have this opportunity to bring it to the screen and be at the tiller so it can be faithful, is key to me.</p><p>\"This is the stuff I\'ve been dealing with since I was a kid. This is the stuff I spend my free time daydreaming about, as an adult as well. And I get to bring it into life. And there is no greater reason that I joined the industry than doing something like this, and I\'m very happy to be here.\"His comments might come off to the casual observer as those of a guy trying to make lemons into a fine English ale, but Henry\'s Warhammer fandom is legitimate and well-documented. He spent his quarantine time during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic painting Warhammer miniatures; he has a little cameo in Total War: Warhammer 2; he interrupts interviews to talk about Warhammer; and if you happen to get a Warhammer reference wrong, he will politely but firmly correct you. So when Henry says he really is just that jazzed to be doing a Warhammer thing, even after unexpectedly losing two high-profile gigs over the span of just a few months, you kinda have to believe him.</p><p>The debut of the Warhammer 40,000 cinematic universe is likely still a long way off: The deal to make it happen between Games Workshop and Amazon Studios was only nailed down in December 2023, and Cavill apparently hasn\'t even made up his mind about who he wants to be yet. Inquisitor? Primarch? God-Emperor of Mankind? The possibilities seem endless. But even though details remain distant, if Cavill is really as happy about how it\'s all worked out as he says, then I have to admit that there\'s a little bit of fanboy inside of me who\'s really happy for him.</p>', 'images/6.jpeg', 18, 2, 6, '2023-12-04 11:17:05', '2024-02-05 11:17:05'),

Not long after, The Verge reported that Bethesda\'s Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will release on PS5, albeit after a short period of Xbox exclusivity.</p><p>It\'s no big deal that Hi-Fi Rush will release for Nintendo Switch, because Microsoft has released several of its first-party games on that platform already.

While some criticized Tom & Jerry\'s cast for distracting from the pair, it\'s clear many viewers had an overall fondness for the comedy.</p><p>Due to the franchise\'s simple premise, it likely rose to the top of Netflix\'s charts because of its inoffensive slapstick humor.

And while he seemed to lose his way for a while on the family entertainment front, he’s since made a return to the kind of elastic elation he found in those early years in – of all things – the Sonic The Hedgehog movies. In the recent cinematic out, and its sequel, Carrey stepped into the role of the villainous Dr. Robotnik with gleeful aplomb. But in April 2022, he seemed to announce his retirement in an interview with Access Hollywood – throwing doubt on whether he’d return as Robotnik for Sonic 3.</p><p>Well, good news for Sonic fans and Carrey heads: he’ll be back in that big moustache later this year when Sonic The Hedgehog 3 hits cinemas. A fresh teaser for the threequel showed an explosive title treatment for the film, soundtracked by Carrey’s distinctive cackle:The film – from returning director Jeff Fowler who helmed the two previous entries – will not only bring back Sonic, Tails, Knuckles (who’s receiving his own spin-off series later in 2024), and Robotnik. The exciting addition for Sonic fans is the tease of Shadow The Hedgehog joining the fray this time – though who exactly will voice him remains to be seen. With the film due to hit cinemas on 20 December this year, expect more news on that in the not-too-distant future.</p>', 'images/14.jpg', 21, 3, 15, '2024-03-06 11:24:21', '2024-03-08 11:24:21'),

And this summer, we’ll see Murphy reprising the role in the long-awaited fourth outing, 30 years after the (not-so-beloved) Beverly Hills Cop 3. While the specific release details were being kept under wraps by Netflix, where the film will find its home, they’ve since unveiled an official arrival date for you to mark in your diary.</p><p>Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F – as the fourth instalment is officially known – will arrive in your homes on 3 July, making it a proper summer tentpole for the streamer. The news came accompanied by a fresh image from the movie:</p><p>This one is directed by Mark Molloy, and sees Axel Foley return to Beverly Hills to help solve a case – one being investigated by his criminal defence attorney daughter Jane (played by Taylour Paige). His new partner is Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s Detective Bobby, with Kevin Bacon as their senior Captain Grant. Plus, a whole host of familiar faces from the precinct will be gracing the screen – Judge Reinhold, Paul Reiser, Bronson Pinchot, and John Ashton are all back. Jerry Bruckheimer is back as producer, while the screenplay comes from Will Beall, Tom Gormican and Kevin Etten.</p><p>So there you have it – Axel Foley returns, slap bang in the middle of summer.

Its cumulative total includes $763.8 million internationally and $241.2 million at the domestic box office.</p><p>For the fourth film in the franchise, Paramount shook things up, upgrading original series star Shia LaBeouf for Mark Wahlberg and shooting large parts of the movie in China in order to better appeal to that burgeoning market.</p><p>The studio is making sure it doesn’t let its golden goose fly the coop. This week it announced a three-year deal extension with Bay and his production company, Platinum Dunes.The fourth installment of the Paramount/Hasbro-backed series, once again directed by Michael Bay, is believed to possibly become the first film of 2014 to hit $100 million in its box-office debut. Overseas, Age of Extinction has already earned $30 million, including record-setting Thursday midnight previews in China ($3.5 million) and a stellar $5.5 million Thursday start in Russia, the second biggest opening day of all time.</p><p>Read what top critics are saying about Transformers: Age of Extinction:</p><p>The Hollywood Reporter‘s film critic Clarence Tsui says in his review that “there’s a lot of state-of-the-art 3D chicanery, and the film is a marked improvement over the wholesale inhuman chaos of the last two installments, 2009’s Revenge of the Fallen and 2011’s Dark of the Moon. But the bloat of this latest entry — at 165 minutes, the longest of the lot — suggests that Michael Bay and his team are struggling to rejuvenate the whole premise. … It has neither the first film’s sporadic comedic pleasures born of the interactions between its humans and robots, nor does it attain the hyper-sensationalism that makes the second and third installments utterly over-the-top showcases of gratuitous demolition.”</p><p>Besides being “dull,” the film includes odd allusions to directors like Stanley Kubrick and John Ford, but a few digs at Bay himself for “cheap laughs,” and “even when the action switches to Hong Kong — a twist designed to qualify the film for Chinese co-production status and a bigger slice of the Asian box-office pie — the noise never abates.” Even more so, Wahlberg’s “troubled interactions with Tessa [Peltz] and barbed exchanges with Shane [Reynor] are cliched or underwritten, and his ability to morph into a bazooka-wielding warrior (“This alien gun can really kick ass!”) limits his register further.” Tucci’s “clownish antics while racing for survival in a Hong Kong tenement block are probably the highlight of the film.”</p>', 'images/16.jpg', 7, 3, 10, '2024-01-30 11:26:04', '2024-02-21 11:26:04'),
(17, 'Critic’s Notebook: Enthusiasm Waxed and Waned, but ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ Played a Long Game', '<p>Owing to series creator-star Larry David’s unique deal with HBO, Curb Your Enthusiasm never seemed like the sort of show that would formally conclude. </p><p>Since Curb premiered back in 2000, the official line on future seasons was always some variation on: “Curb will be back whenever Larry has a story he wants to tell.” That sometimes meant months; more recently, it meant six years during which no enthusiasm whatsoever was curbed. When HBO announced in December that Curb’s 12th season would be its last, it felt like a violation of the show’s eternal Schrödinger’s comedy status according to which, between seasons, Curb was always somehow both alive and dead, its future hinging on Larry David eventually finding something fresh to be irritated by (a prospect as likely as Dick Wolf locating undepicted professions in Chicago).Perhaps the most surprising thing about the new Curb Your Enthusiasm season — which premiered Feb. 4 — is that, despite the show having no mysteries that require solving and no loose ends to tie up, there actually is a whiff of finality about it.</p><p>It’s a finality that’s likely to give some still-disgruntled fans flashbacks to May 14, 1998, when the last episode of Seinfeld found the main characters getting arrested in Latham, Massachusetts, for a violation of a so-called Good Samaritan Law. Jerry, Elaine and George were thrown in jail for failing to provide assistance to the victim of a carjacking. They weren’t good people, the Seinfeld gang, but audiences blanched at the idea that their narcissism was worthy of climactic punishment. The finale was widely disliked.</p><p>Critics have been sent nine of 10 episodes from this Curb run, so I don’t know if Larry wraps the series incarcerated in a similar fashion. But that’s definitely where he ended the season premiere, after delivering a bottle of water to dear Auntie Rae (Ellia English) and therefore breaking Georgia’s controversial Election Integrity Act of 2021. </p><p>Larry David having his fictionalized alter ego locked up for an actual instance of altruistic behavior proves that he’s been paying attention to the pressures of ending a television show. In fact, he’s fixating on it. Multiple episodes this season include other characters referencing that although Larry left Seinfeld for long stretches toward its end, he returned for the series finale — a fact that he consistently acknowledges with the look of a man sipping on 26-year-old milk. Will the end of Curb Your Enthusiasm prove that David has learned from the experience on Seinfeld? Or, in remaining consistent with the series’ themes, will self-awareness prove to be no competition for egomaniacal inertia? </p><p>In this way, David has turned the 12th season of Curb into something cumulative — “I hate my life. You don’t want to witness it,” Larry tells a guest star this season, a perfectly ironic summation of the series’ theme — and its ultimate destination into something worth pondering, with callbacks and returning characters along the journey.</p><p>A formal declaration of “the final season” provides us an opportunity to reflect and recognize that, in our era of truncated series runs, we won’t see many more 120-episode cable shows in the future. (FX’s It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia will soon have its Schrödinger’s comedy status alone.) In its finest moments, Curb Your Enthusiasm delivered carefully crafted farce at a level the medium has rarely witnessed before. Episodes were peppered with outsized characters, both recurring and guest, whom the show sent out into self-referential orbit only to bring them back with hilarious precision. In my favorite installments — I’ll single out “Mister Softee,” with its unlikely climactic redemption for Bill Buckner  — the effect was dazzling. In my favorite seasons — season four, with Larry’s Broadway debut in The Producers, or season six, with the post-Katrina arrival of the Blacks — David and his collaborators managed to string elements across 10 episodes before cinching them tight by the finale.</p><p>Curb Your Enthusiasm often was capable of achieving an effect of cosmic cohesiveness; unlike Seinfeld, which alienated some viewers by suddenly enforcing karmic standards in its finale, Curb has always been rooted in Larry’s inevitable comeuppances. That thematic consistency was all the more astonishing given how much of the show has always been improvised.</p> ', 'images/17.jpg', 3, 5, 13, '2024-03-19 11:27:05', '2024-03-28 11:27:05'),

His brother, Stephen, who’s written with him on both Atlanta and Swarm, told him he was simply watching it wrong. “He’s like, ‘It’s a good date movie. Who cares if they did it well?’ Everybody gets to pretend to be Brad or Angelina, and you go home holding hands like, ‘We’re not a bad team.’ And he’s right.” But what if there were another way, he wondered. He enlisted Francesca “Fran” Sloane, a writer on Atlanta, and they reconceived it as a romance drama that masquerades as a spy series. Their Smiths would be thrust together — given a marriage license, a Manhattan brownstone and strict orders to not fuck up.</p><p>Both Glover and Sloane, who serves as showrunner, understood that the intimacy between the pair was what was going to make this show sexy. “I always remember when Amy Seimetz directed a scene in Atlanta where I’m going down on Zazie Beetz’s character. She was like, ‘Do you want this to be hot to men or women?’ ” recounts Glover. “And I go, ‘Women! Oh my God, who gives a fuck if a guy likes this?’ And it’s really important to me that this show is hot in that way.”</p><p>Initially, Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge — who’d co-starred with Glover in Solo: A Star Wars Film — was attached to co-write and star. But that didn’t work out, so they recast her role with PEN15 creator-star Maya Erskine. She and Glover had never even met, but both got their start at NYU’s Tisch School (Glover, 40, a few years ahead of 36-year-old Erskine).

(19, 'Jeremy Renner on His New Superpower (After “Dying and Coming Back” to Life)', '<p>Just over a year after suffering a horrific snowplow accident on New Year’s Day that shattered 38 bones and left his life in limbo, Jeremy Renner will show off his miraculous recovery to an estimated audience of 113 million. This Sunday, viewers will see his first Super Bowl ad, for Silk Protein, a product the dairy-avoiding Avenger says he has been drinking for years and which he credits in part for his Lazarus-like resuscitation. The 30-second spot, titled “Silk Feel Planty Good” will give his fans plenty to parse. It turns his morning ritual — preparing his protein shake — into a fast-paced action sequence as he slices strawberries in mid-air, high kicks, dances on the table, and sings a version of James Brown’s “I Feel Good” that imbues the lyrics with profound new meaning. He then flings a wooden spoon with Hawkeye-worthy aim into a carton of Silk, inches from the face of his 10-year-old daughter, Ava. “Just getting back to my routine,” he says, as he takes a seat next to her. In a conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Renner spoke about the inspiration behind the ad, the joy it has given him to defy doctors’ grim prognoses and his day-by-day plans for the future, including a possible return to the Marvel franchise.This ad is about Silk, but it seems to be saying a lot more about you. He’s back! He can fight! He can dance and sing! Did working on the spot itself play a role in your recovery?</p><p>I think it’s a representation of the recovery. A few days after the anniversary of the accident, my daughter and I were just looking at each other like: How far we’ve come. What a wonderful celebration. And there’s a wonderful synergy with Silk — it’s something that I used all through my recovery and they didn’t know it [when they approached me]. It’s how I take my nutrients and all my medication; it’s the only thing I really put in my body to be honest with you, along with supplements that I would put in my protein shakes. The campaign is kind of based on me, so it’s very authentic. This isn’t me having to play a part, or even Ava having to play a part. This is us in the morning. It was one of the most fun things I could do. And it’s something my daughter and I get to take with us.</p><p>Early on, I told her to wait for me, because she saw me busted up with 38 broken bones. I said, “If you wait for me, I promise you I’ll get better.” I had somebody to get better for — this little girl. And then, here we are, with Silk, getting to celebrate this, man. This feels deep, spiritually and emotionally for us; my entire family. And I hope that will resonate and bring some joy to other people.</p><p>Did you coach your daughter Ava at all?</p><p>Not really. I tried to kind of let her do it. Just work with the director. If there’s anything I did differently, it’s to bring her to the monitor to see what they were trying to film. There’s a lot going on with the cameras spinning and milk cartons going over, and all these little gags that they had to do. And she’d say her line and they would change the line. She thought that having to do the repeated action over and over again meant that she wasn’t doing it right. So she started to get more shy and not quite as confident. But I let her know: Look, this is how it goes.</p><p>You broke 38 bones, your rib cage and your eye socket have been rebuilt with metal … What does an X-ray of you look like today?</p><p>(Laughs.) A lot of screws. A lot of metal. It’s like Titanium Man, I suppose. And it’s stuff that has to stay in me. Until it fails, I guess. But it’s good for a while.</p><p>I imagine it sets off alarms at airport security.</p><p>Yeah. What’s good, though, is that most people are pretty aware. It’s the wands that they set off. But they have certain settings on those things so you don’t go off and create Fourth of July fireworks and create more attention that I don’t want at an airport.</p><p>The action element in this ad will send a clear signal to Marvel that you’re in shape to play Hawkeye again. So are there plans to don the quiver again?</p><p>I don’t know. I don’t know the answer. The answer is yes, if I get a phone call and they want to do it, whether it’s season two of Hawkeye the series, or something in the Marvel universe in cinema. Yeah, is the answer. If I’m welcome back, I’m always gonna say, yeah.</p>', 'images/19.jpg', 14, 5, 9, '2024-03-26 11:29:18', '2024-03-27 11:29:18'),

And Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, one of the WWE’s biggest stars — turned global movie star — was set to ring the opening bell, in connection with an agreement to join TKO’s board of directors.</p><p>Speaking to attendees in the NYSE’s ornate 6th floor board room that morning, Johnson accepted a gold TKO championship belt from McMahon and TKO CEO Ari Emanuel. “Life can be so incredible and so unpredictable,” Johnson said, noting his familial ties to the company. “I get a chance to sit at the table that my grandfather and my dad helped build … Ultimately, that thing that you’re building, ends up building you.” As Johnson rang the NYSE bell, Emanuel stood directly to his left, while McMahon was directly to his right. The past of the WWE on one side, and the future on the other.</p><p>The week was supposed to be capped off Jan. 27 at Tropicana Field in Tampa, Florida, where the company was to host one of its signature annual events, the Royal Rumble. But a bombshell lawsuit, followed by a fateful decision from a major sponsor, changed the course of the firm. By the time the Royal Rumble began, McMahon was gone from TKO, seemingly for good, as it sought to distance itself from McMahon’s alleged past transgressions, as it endeavored to make employees feel safe, and as it responded to an impact to the bottom line.</p><p>Those concerns culminated the evening of Jan. 26, when Emanuel and TKO president and COO Mark Shapiro called McMahon and told him it would be in the best interest of the company for him to resign. He agreed, and submitted his resignation. “He will no longer have a role with TKO Group Holdings or WWE,” WWE president Nick Khan wrote in a memo to staff at 8:30 p.m. that evening, announcing McMahon’s resignation to employees.</p><p>The turning point was a day earlier, when the lawsuit from a former WWE employee, Janel Grant, accused McMahon of sex trafficking and battery. While the broad claims of McMahon’s hush money payments and accusations of sexual misconduct were previously known, the specific, graphic details in Grant’s lawsuit were new. McMahon, for his part, said in response, “I stand by my prior statement that Ms. Grant’s lawsuit is replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.”</p><p>The business ramifications of the lawsuit became clear quickly, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. Snack brand Slim Jim, which last year signed on for the WWE’s biggest sponsorship deal to date, paused its promotional activities in the wake of the suit. Slim Jim was slated to be a major sponsor of the Royal Rumble. “Slim Jim values integrity and respect in all of our partnerships,” the company said in a statement, adding that “This decision reflects our commitment to our brand values and responsibility to our community.”</p><p>The move was a tipping point. Endeavor took the UFC, which had long struggled in the sponsorship side of the business, and made it palatable to major brands like Bud Light, which inked a $100 million-plus deal with the company last year. The company has similar hopes for the WWE. In the wake of the lawsuit, McMahon’s presence posed a challenge to that strategy, as the Slim Jim decision demonstrated. The snack company reversed its decision after McMahon resigned, returning in time for the Royal Rumble.</p>', 'images/20.jpg', 14, 5, 13, '2024-03-20 11:30:10', '2024-03-26 11:30:10');

I don’t know that anyone has ever done that.”</p><p>“The media and creative plan that we executed has never been done at this scale, ever,” adds Ross Martin, president of marketing agency Known, which produced the spot. “And what we’re able to do is use our technology at Known to optimize all of the media and all of the creative for every single market across the country, which means that John Stamos is literally talking to you, no matter where you live.</p><p>“So if you’re in St. Louis, you’re in Redding, you’re in Albuquerque, he’s literally talking to you in what seems like a national ad, because it’s in the Super Bowl, but it’s in local time,” he adds. “And so that’s going to be sort of jarring and shocking, and very addressable and very relevant.”</p><p>The local portion of the ad itself will be a surprise (though you can see it below), but Known and Zeam are hoping it surprises viewers.</p><p>“John Stamos is incredibly sexy, incredibly funny, and incredibly adorable, but he’s a completely unnecessary celebrity spokesperson, which you really won’t find and don’t need very much of on Zeam,” Martin says. “And that’s the joke, right?”</p><p>Zeam will launch with more than 300 local stations covering about 80 percent of the U.S., including deals with Gray, CBS, Hearst and Morgan Murphy.

Alongside the usual PR-driven fluff about the sparkly frocks stars Dua Lipa and Bryce Dallas Howard were wearing, and the argyle-patterned evening gown sported by producer Claudia Schiffer (who is also Vaughn’s partner), there was much ado about Schiffer’s key accessory of the evening: a matching backpack with a round plastic window enclosing her cat Chip, a fetching gray Scottish Fold who also plays a major role in the film.</p><p>From where I was sitting, some distance from the stage, Chip looked grumpy and a little alarmed when taken out of the bag and shown off in front of the auditorium. Then again, that breed always looks a little grumpy. Nevertheless, there were soon outraged national media headlines, with British animal welfare charity Cats Protection decrying the use of the windowed traveling case since it could leave a cat “feeling exposed and vulnerable.” Moreover, Cats Protection worried that more Scottish Folds will be bred to meet demand generated by the film, which would be bad because the breed tends towards serious degenerative joint disease.</p><p>This feline-themed kerfuffle is worth mentioning because there’s a strong chance that this bout of negative publicity might seem like good press once reactions to Argylle start landing. Sure, it’s entirely possible that the film will find a constituency who will love its mirthless, shouty performances, its tortured random plot twists and its appallingly shonky-looking CGI. But there is also a distinct possibility audiences will turn up their noses at this like it’s a fresh litter box deposit.</p><p>Although Vaughn’s box office track record as a producer is good — he shepherded Rocketman as well as early Guy Ritchie hits Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch — his career as a director has had both substantial peaks (the first Kick-Ass film, Kingsman: The Secret Service) and considerable troughs (The King’s Man). Although allegedly made with a $200m budget and featuring what looks on paper like a fancy-pants cast, Argylle may mark a new low, with jokes that struggle to land; an attenuated running time that tests patience; cartoonish, stylized violence that is, almost literally, little more than smoke and mirrors; and Apple product placement so aggressive it feels like a kind of assault.</p><p>Readers who are extremely spoiler adverse are advised to read no further, because what little fun the film has to offer is baked into the way the plot keeps wrongfooting the viewer. Taking inspiration from James Bond movies by way of the Mission: Impossible franchise, the opening sequence seems to jump into action in medias res as it introduces a smooth, dad pun-dropping spy named Argylle (Henry Cavill), working a case in a picturesque corner of Greece.</p><p>After busting a few weird-looking moves on a dance floor with vampish antagonist Lagrange (Dua Lipa), Argylle sees her escape his grasp, her henchfolk killing his colleague Keira (Ariana DeBose) at the entrance to the night club along the way. Argylle takes off after Lagrange, resulting in a massively destructive race through the town that is stopped only when Argylle’s muscled techie wingman Wyatt (John Cena) snatches her off a motorcycle.</p><p>Just when the scene takes a dramatic turn, a hard cut reveals this is not the reality of the film itself, but a fictional world being written by waitress-turned-novelist Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard, in sad-girl mode, along the lines of her character in the Black Mirror episode Nosedive). Although she’s the successful author of a series of novels about super-spy Argylle, Elly lives a quiet life in a secluded house in Colorado, with only her cat Alfie for company. (The aforementioned Chip is credited as the performer, although appallingly unconvincing CGI is used for some of Alfie’s stunts and presumably a few stand-in cats or even fakes in the many scenes where he’s stuck inside that backpack, barely visible.)</p><p>Elly’s mother Ruth (Catherine O’Hara, wasted) offers constructive criticism over the phone on Elly’s latest work in progress, which features the opening scene we just saw, but suggests it’s not quite there yet. Deciding to take a train to visit her parents (she’s afraid of flying), Elly sticks Alfie in his cat-pack and sets off on Amtrak for a peaceful trip in first class. But her journey is interrupted by unwanted attention from scruffy, bearded stranger Aidan (Sam Rockwell), who reveals he’s in the espionage business right before he starts engaging in lethal hand-to-hand combat with almost every passenger on the train, all of them seemingly intent on killing Elly.</p><p>So far, so much of this is in the film’s trailer. But what the previews don’t show is how Elly seems to be having hallucinations throughout, often “seeing” her character Argylle fighting off baddies in one moment, then Aiden finishing the move the next, suggesting they might be one and the same in some way.</p><p>As the couple, or trio if you include Alfie, go on the run, ending up in London and an assortment of other evil lairs and exotic locales in the Middle East and the South of France, it becomes clear that life imitates a fair bit of Elly’s art. Or maybe it’s the other way around? Either way, Vaughn and screenwriter Jason Fuchs (Wonder Woman) are quite pleased with all this meta-level tricksiness. It even goes beyond the film itself, as an Argylle book attributed to Elly Conway, a spy novel, has been published and is already on sale. (Copies were given away at the premiere.)</p>', 'images/23.jpg', 5, 4, 13, '2024-03-07 11:33:35', '2024-03-07 11:33:35'),
(24, '‘Orion and the Dark’ Review: Jacob Tremblay and Paul Walter Hauser in Clever Animation Penned by Charlie Kaufman', '<p>The best animated movies are entertaining enough for kids while providing rewarding diversions for older viewers. This Netflix premiere from DreamWorks Animation hits just that sweet spot. Hilariously and movingly tapping into typical childhood anxieties, it’s infused with ample wit of both the visual and verbal variety for adults, the latter courtesy of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) in his return to feature-length animation, nine years after Anomalisa. Much like the streamer’s recent Nimona, Orion and the Dark proves the sort of sophisticated animated project that outshines many recent big-screen toons.</p><p>Many of them are typical for an early adolescent, from being afraid to talk to a classmate crush to suffering abuse from bullies to letting down his sports team. Others are more exotic, such as a terror of murderous clowns hiding in gutters (he can thank Stephen King for that one). And some are of the more existential variety, such as his fear of death. “’Nothing’ is perhaps the one unimaginable thing,” Orion muses, and let’s face it, he makes a lot of sense. He’s the sort of overthinking kid who asks his beleaguered parents (Matt Dellapina, Carla Gugino) to read him bedtime stories from the works of David Foster Wallace.</p><p>But the thing Orion is most fearful of is the dark, something not uncommon among kids. So he’s obviously terrified when Dark (Paul Walter Hauser, perfection in his playful vocal performance) pays him a visit one night, looking like a black, hulking monster but with a surprisingly engaging personality. He attempts to assuage Orion’s fears but doesn’t get very far. “There are a lot of people who are scared of me, but you’re on a whole new level,” Dark complains.</p><p>Dark even tries to convince Orion that he’s a good guy by showing him a seconds-long introductory movie about himself, entitled “Meet Dark,” which is narrated by, who else, Werner Herzog and has titles credited to Saul Bass. “It didn’t get into Sundance,” Dark grouses about his very short magnum opus. “It’s so much better than half of the movies there.”</p><p>Those cinematic in-jokes geared for older viewers are a prime example of Kaufman’s consistently amusing screenplay. The film also includes numerous characters who weren’t in the original book, namely the “Night Entities,” to whom Dark introduces Orion in an effort to better make him understand the mechanics of what goes on when the lights go out.</p><p>They include the ethereal Dreams (a typically regal Angela Bassett), whose body is made of stars; the comforting Sleep (Natasia Demetriou), looking like a plush toy and prone to nodding off at inconvenient moments; the annoying Insomnia (Nat Faxon), who likes to mess with your head; the troubling Unexplained Noises (Golda Rosheuvel), responsible for every mysterious creaking sound that’s ever kept you up at night; and the empathetic Quiet (Aparna Nancheria), whose dialogue has to be subtitled because it speaks in a barely discernible whisper.</p><p>Then there’s Dark’s natural arch-nemesis, the blond and buff Light (Ike Barinhaltz), who’s as self-confident as Dark is insecure. Because Dark worries that since so many people are afraid of him, he’s not such a great guy after all.</p><p> Another wonderful element are the flash-forwards in which we see the now grown-up Orion (comfortingly voiced by Colin Hanks) relating his tale as a bedtime story for his similarly anxious young daughter Hypatia (Mia Akemi Brown). Thanks to some handy time-travel, she soon shows up in his story as well, with the two generations teaming up to overcome their fears together.</p>', 'images/24.jpg', 12, 4, 6, '2024-03-26 11:33:37', '2024-03-29 11:33:37'),
(25, 'Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League review – straddles the brilliant and the banal', '<p>Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight hit cinemas in 2008, it arrived like a demon in the night. Pushing its 12A rating to the limit, this brooding, nihilistic monster was a far cry from Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy. As Heath Ledger’s Joker gleefully rammed a pencil into a mobster’s eye and flames tore the flesh from Harvey Dent’s cheek, my-then-girlfriend’s little brother left the cinema looking mildly traumatised. Adam West prancing around in his tights, this was not.</p><p>Nominated for eight Academy Awards and winning two, Nolan’s batbuster was a genre-elevating triumph. The Bat was back and soon he gave video games a Gotham-filled glow-up. The critically acclaimed Arkham Asylum silently emerged from the shadows in 2009, dragging licensed games out of the bargain bin and thrusting them firmly into the spotlight. Now, nine years after 2015’s Arkham Knight, Gotham’s golden boys are back with a fourth DC adaptation – Suicide Squad.</p><p>Putting you in the blood-stained boots of Harley Quinn, Boomerang, King Shark and Deadshot, it’s up to these Arkham inmates to defend Metropolis from an alien invasion. Where, you may ask, is Batman? Well, unfortunately Earth’s heroes have very much woken up on the wrong side of the bed, with the once noble Justice League brainwashed into doing alien Brainiac’s evil bidding.</p><p>As UFOs rain lasers from the sky and Green Lantern gleefully slaughters human resisters, it falls to our gang of storied losers to save the day – and kill the Justice League. It’s a brilliant narrative setup, and one that its writers play to great comic effect. Yet along with the welcome change from playable hero to villains comes a more eyebrow-raising switch: the move to an online looter shooter. Taking its cues from Destiny and the much-maligned Marvel’s Avengers game, this live service approach sees Rocksteady attempt to marry a tightly directed cinematic story with number-crunching and randomised gun drops.</p><p>Suicide Squad has players inhabiting a cast of timelessly iconic superpowered DC villains, only for them to spend countless hours clutching generic assault rifles. Where few films emulated Nolan’s take on the cape and cowl, Rocksteady’s up close and personal combat became the gold standard for brawling in video games. It’s jarring, then, that Suicide Squad’s combat feels so pedestrian. Swapping Arkham’s winning mix of stealth and fisticuffs for flimsy firearms, your antiheroes spend the game leaping across Metropolis’s bland sandbox, riddling forgettable humanoid zombies full of lead. Where Rocksteady once championed innovation, Suicide Squad’s mindless XP-gathering side missions feel bafflingly like the soulless licensed games it rebelled against.</p><p>It’s telling that the best bits are when it feels its most Arkham. Once the faceless hordes of enemies fade out of view and the camera zooms in close, the game shines, with your brilliantly rendered squad taking on the corrupted members of the Justice League in gloriously silly villainous vignettes. Whether it’s tracking MacGuffins with Lex Luther or battling a particularly sociopathic interpretation of The Flash, watching the Justice League break bad is a joy to behold. From gawking as Batman remorselessly murders policemen to witnessing Superman melt a hero with his laser eyes, there’s more than a touch of The Boys and Invincible to this dark slice of DC.</p><p>It’s compellingly acted stuff, too, with Suicide Squad’s gory gross-outs and inane gags pulling off the rare feat of being genuinely funny, not just “funny for a video game”.</p><p>Yet whenever Rocksteady veers close to channelling its former Gotham glories, you’re thrust back into a world of tedium. While the combat improves as you upgrade your weapons, its blend of bullet-sponge enemies and flashy finishers never feels quite as fluid at battering goons as Batman did back in 2009.</p><p>Ultimately, Warner Brothers live-service ambitions rob players of a remarkable comic-book caper. The result is a game that’s as confused as its titular characters. Just as these reluctant heroes find themselves battling against their villainous natures, Rocksteady’s storytelling ambition struggles to break free of its live-service trappings. Since its reveal as a looter shooter, the internet has declared Suicide Squad an abomination – the antithesis of the classics that Rocksteady once made. The reality is somewhere in between, a game that straddles both the brilliant and the banal. As Rocksteady is surely learning from Suicide Squad’s hostile fan reception, you either die a licensed game hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.</p>', 'images/25.jpg', 16, 4, 5, '2023-12-05 11:34:35', '2024-03-04 11:34:35');
